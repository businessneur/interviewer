### ðŸ“Š Scalability Specifications

The following table details the expected concurrent user capacity, resource usage, and scaling methods for key components:

| Component        | Concurrent Users | Resource Usage              | Scaling Method            |
| :--------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Piper TTS** | 1000+            | CPU: Low, RAM: ~150MB       | Horizontal (CPU pods)     |
| **Kokoro TTS** | 500-800          | GPU: Medium, RAM: ~300MB    | Horizontal (GPU pods)     |
| **Faster-Whisper** | 1000+            | GPU: High, RAM: ~1GB        | Horizontal (GPU pods)     |
| **Celery Workers** | Auto-scale       | CPU: Variable               | KEDA queue-based          |
| **Redis Cache** | 10,000+          | RAM: ~2GB                   | Master-Replica setup      |

### ðŸ’° Cost Optimization Strategy

We've implemented a robust strategy to minimize operational costs while maintaining high performance and reliability:

#### Resource Allocation
Our compute resources are strategically allocated based on workload characteristics:

* **70% CPU workload:** Primarily handled by **Piper TTS**, which is highly cost-effective due to its CPU optimization.
* **20% GPU workload:** Dedicated to **Faster-Whisper STT**, leveraging GPUs for its high-performance demands.
* **10% GPU workload:** Allocated to **Kokoro TTS**, serving as a higher-quality fallback.

#### Auto-Scaling Benefits
Leveraging intelligent auto-scaling mechanisms provides significant cost savings:

* **Scale to Zero:** Celery workers can automatically scale down to zero instances during idle periods, drastically reducing compute costs when demand is low.
* **Queue-based Scaling:** Workers only scale up when there are tasks in the queue, ensuring resources are provisioned precisely when needed.
* **Spot Instances:** We can utilize cheaper spot instances for non-critical or interruptible workloads, further optimizing costs.
* **Caching:** By caching common interview questions and generated audio files in Redis, we reduce redundant compute on our STT/TTS backends, lowering operational expenses.
